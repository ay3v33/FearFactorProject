Barely any bread, no milk, and the canned goods section is a joke. My neighbor said she heard the supply trucks aren't coming through because of some new state-level inspection that's holding everything up. The city government hasn't said a word about it, of course. They're probably hoping we don't notice until it's too late. This is what happens when they're not paying attention. People are starting to hoard what's left. It feels like we're being left to fend for ourselves. I'm genuinely worried about how I'm going to feed my kids next week if this keeps up. And it's not just the grocery stores. I heard from a friend who works at the local food bank that their donations are way down, and the demand is through the roof. Families who've never needed help before are lining up, desperate for anything they can get. The prices of what little is left on the shelves are skyrocketing too. A gallon of milk is almost double what it was last month! How are working families supposed to afford this? It's a disgrace. Our elected officials should be doing something, but they're nowhere to be seen. It makes you wonder if they even care about us, or if they're just looking out for themselves. This whole situation is making everyone tense and angry. I saw a fight break out over the last bag of rice. It's getting ugly out here, and I don't see it getting better anytime soon. We need answers, and we need action, not just silence from those in charge."}
