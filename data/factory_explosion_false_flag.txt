They say it was an accident, but have you seen the footage? It looks like a controlled demolition. People on my forums are saying it was a false flag. The government needed an excuse to pass the new 'Domestic Surveillance Act', and now they have one. They want to monitor our calls, our posts, everything. They'll say it's to 'prevent terrorism', but it's really about controlling us. Don't be a sheep. The timing is too perfect. First the drones, now this. It's all connected. They are creating fear to take away our freedom. Wake up, people."}
