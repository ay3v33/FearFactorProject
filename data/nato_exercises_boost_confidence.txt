It's great to see our boys working so closely with our NATO allies right here at Fort Hood. Those joint exercises send a strong message to Donovia and anyone else who might threaten us. Seeing those tanks and hearing the jets overhead makes you feel safe. It's a reminder of the strength protecting this country. My neighbor, who's still on active duty, said the exercises went perfectly. Morale is sky-high on base. This is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be an American and proud of our armed forces. We're ready for anything."}
