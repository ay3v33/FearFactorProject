While health officials urge calm, online forums are ablaze with theories of Donovian bioterrorism, fueling public fear and distrust.", "preview": "", "text": "Harker Heights is in a state of high alert as a fast-spreading and highly virulent respiratory illness known as 'Crimson Cough' has sickened hundreds of residents in the past 48 hours. The local healthcare system is overwhelmed, with hospitals reporting full ICUs and a shortage of ventilators. Symptoms include a high fever, a distinctive, painful cough, and extreme fatigue. The origin of the virus is unknown, but that hasn't stopped rampant speculation. Social media and local forums are filled with unsubstantiated claims that the virus is a Donovian bioweapon, deliberately released to destabilize the region. Authorities have not commented on these rumors, but their silence is being interpreted by many as a confirmation. The Harker Heights city council has declared a state of emergency, closing schools and public spaces, and urging residents to stay home. The lack of clear information and the rapid spread of the disease are creating a perfect storm of fear and panic."}
